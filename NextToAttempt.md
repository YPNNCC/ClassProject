### Next Tasks to Attempt
#### The next few items I will attempt to complete will be as follows:

##### Medium Difficulty:
- Ensure that all inputs for all of the methods (ie: addUser) have all user input validated. One current issue is the permissionLevel input from the user which could cause issues.
- Rework the sanitizeInput method so that it allows additional special characters for passwords which will allow passwords to be stronger.
- Additional sanitization for all other user inputs and ensure that all temp files are deleted without issue to prevent an outside attacker gaining access to it.

##### Hard Difficulty:
- Look into a better way to store the user information rather than in plaintext.
